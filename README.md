# Schlueter's zsh-config

This is my latest attempt at a config management system for my home directory which is both easy to install and neglectibly easy to update.

## Installation

Clone this repo somewhere, say *~/.config/zsh*, and create a *~/.zshenv* minimally containing:

```
ZDOTDIR="$HOME/.config/zsh"
```
